## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a system that algorithmically creates homework and/or quizzes, distributes these homework/quiz notebooks to students through the cloud, collects the finished notebooks from the students, and then aggregates the results. Several types of homework and quizzes are planned. In some cases it will be possible to autograde the entire submission. In other cases, text responses will be compiled for grading. In all cases a report will be generated that allows easy assessment and entry of results into a course management system such as BlackBoard. 

There are many benefits to this approach. Algorithmic problem generation will encourage students to spend more time on task and this will lead to increased learning; although students often believe that copying a solution from Chegg or a another student is the same as working through the problem themselves, it is not. This approach can gradually introduce students to the Wolfram language and computational thinking. The use of Wolfram Programming Lab will also allow for easy deployment. The instructor will use the premium version of Wolfram Programming Lab to distribute notebooks, but students will be able to use the free version of Wolfram Programming Lab. This approach reduces or eliminates any institutional IT setup issues.
